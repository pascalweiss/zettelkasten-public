She gave me toothbrush and toothpaste and floss
And witty remarks with arms crossed

Now I don't think to boast
But what thrilled me the most
Was her eggs in the morning with toast

She gave me pillow and oversized shirt
And mattress with speckles of dirt

Yea she was quite a host
But what thrilled me the most
Was her eggs in the morning with toast

I sat there watching her 
Without a word
Preparing me the perfect plate
She sat it down for me 
And before I could speak
She told me that she was running late

She kissed and threw me out quick
I thanked her and heared the door click

But I never felt closer
Than taking a doze of her
eggs I the morning ...

Theres really nothing better than
Eggs in the morning with toast
