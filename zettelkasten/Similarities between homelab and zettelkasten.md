- **Interaction with ideas**: Both are made for developing knowledge and ideas about the things that you are interested in. Instead of having fleeting ideas only in the head for a short period of time, both, zettelkasten and a homelab allow to stick with an idea, to interact with it (by text or by code).
- **Motivation**: A zettelkasten can be seen as a personal intellectual treasure. And adding thoughts and ideas makes it more valuable over time. The same can be seen for homelabs. Adding more code, more concepts to it makes it more valuable over time. It brings personal gain, on an intellectual level, independently from physical costs. This helps immensely to keep track on your ideas. 
- **Refined content**: The code should compile and run without errors. Otherwise it is useless. Also it should stay maintainable and extensible over time. Clean code is essential. This is similar for Zettelkasten. [[A Zettel should be publishable]]. It should be atomic. Hence it follows certain quality requirements.
- **Publishable**: Since both are created with high quality requirements, they have potential of being published. This allows you to give something back. People can read your ideas, copy them or build themselves a picture of you.
