I want to create a network of my own thoughts using notes. It should be like a second brain. It should encourage me to articulate, structure, and preserve my thoughts.  

There are various systems for this. One of them is by **Niklas Luhmann** and is called “Zettelkasten”. Although there are others, I want to try this one from now on.

It also includes additional tools for task management (see [[Task Management]]):
- **Calendar**: Here I can put things, that I want or have to do at a certain time
- **To Do List**: Collection of all other things, that I want to do in some time in the future
