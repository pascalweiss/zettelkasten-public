Generally, I’d say that the first premise in everything I code is that I deeply understand what I am doing. Solving problems on one’s own is the only way to grow one’s coding skills. However, sometimes there are small obstacles that can be solved quickly but may block a coder for an unreasonable amount of time. I remember that when I started coding, I sometimes spent hours fixing a single small bug. I scoured Stack Overflow and googled stack traces. These situations were neither productive nor particularly educational. In such cases, it doesn't really make any sense for me to avoid using an AI.
