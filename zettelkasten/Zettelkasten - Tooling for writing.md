For my Zettelkasten I use Obsidian (see [[docu - Obsidian]]) as editor and document organizer. This way, each page (or Zettel) is written and formatted in markdown (see [[docu - Markdown]]). This also allows to include page-links and hashtags to connect thoughts to each other. 
The rules, with which I connect individual pages are described here: [[Connection Rules for Zettels]]

Also I'd like to publish my Zettelkasten some day in form of a digital garden (see [[Digital Garden - Publishing Zettelkasten to the web]])
