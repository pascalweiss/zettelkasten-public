#### A Zettelkasten should:
- ... clarify ideas and thoughts
- ... bring structure into ones own thinking, see [[Schreiben ist Denken]]
- ... help to prioritize and evaluate ideas and thoughts
- ... be a tool

#### Zettelkasten should NOT:
- ... collect information instead of thought. I.e. the content should come from one self and should not be copy-pasted by some other source. 
- ... bring technical issues that are distracting
- ... be a philosophical thing that requires a lot of cognitive resources
