### Architecture
To avoid issues that may occur in the kubernetes cluster, I want my Gitlab instance to run in docker-container, outside the cluster. 

### Emails
Gitlab is configured to send emails via my email relay mailgun (see [[tool - mailgun]]).

### Backlinks
```dataview 
list from [[#]] where contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link)
```
