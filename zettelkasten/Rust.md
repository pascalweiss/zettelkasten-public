Rust is a compiled, memory safe programming language, that supports procedural, functional and object oriented programming. It combines a high level of simplicity with low level performance (like in C/C++). Memory safety is achieved by its concept "ownership and borrowing", instead with garbage collection.
It is supposed to be used for systems where high performance is critical (game engines, databases, operating systems, etc.). This makes it also a good choice for targeting web assembly (see [[WebAssembly]]). 
It provides standard lib for handling I/O, filesystem access, concurrency and many more. It also provides a package manager called "cargo", with which packages called "crates" can be integrated.
