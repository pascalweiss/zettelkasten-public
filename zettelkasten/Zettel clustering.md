A set of Zettels where many interconnections are given can be interpreted as a cluster. Such clusters are likely to represent a certain topic. 
It is likely that a cluster still has connections to other clusters. These connections can be a point of interest. It may be, that they provide a new view or idea on a topic, that wasn't seen before.
