Quartz is a tool for building a static website from markdown (see [[docu - Markdown]]). It can be used for hosting a zettelkasten (see [[My Zettelkasten]]). 

While it provides some plugins for enriching the resulting website, it does not provide the same features as in obsidian. E.g. it does not provide dataview for generating additional content. 

Still it is a nice looking GUI and many developers use it for publishing their thoughts.
