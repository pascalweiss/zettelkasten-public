These are resources that are outside of my Second Brain (see [[Second Brain]]) and are collected in `path /input`. Additionally, I put a tag to them: `#consume`. 

**Meaning**: These are resources, that I hadn't had time for, when I found them. I keep them for later consumption. This also allows me to prevent senseless consumption on e.g. youtube or instagram.
