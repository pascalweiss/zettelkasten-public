Bruce W. Tuckman (1965) defined four stages of group development that groups go through. These are:

#### Forming
First orientation phase. People have different experiences. And they know about it. So they are polite and cautious. 
#### Storming
Team members start focusing on project. Conflicts - in values, priorities, processes, etc. - become visible (see [[Zwischenmenschliche Konflikte]]). In development teams, this might concern test coverage, review process, coding guidelines, definition of done, definition of ready and more.
#### Norming
Team spirit develops. First successes support the team solidarity. Team commits more and more to its own processes. Team members become more self confident and open.  
#### Performing
This is the stage where performance starts to peak. This includes motivation, creativity and flexibility. The team members know their responsibilities.
