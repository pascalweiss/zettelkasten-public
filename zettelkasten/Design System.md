A Design System is a tool that demonstrates a set of UI Elements (buttons, tables, inputs, etc.). It is a running application frontend application, e.g. a website. The UI elements are implemented in this application, so that the user can see and interact them. So developers can easily get an overview about these UI Elements.
Developers can also extend the design easily, so that new UI elements can easily be integrated, and changes on existing elements are adaptable. 

It works great together with a [[pattern lib]]
