This is the entry point that describes my approach to Zettelkasten. It is based on the course [[udemy - The Zettelkasten-method-in-obsidian]] by Mischa Van Den Burg.

Basically my Zettelkasten system has the following main elements: 
- [[Zettelkasten - Tooling for writing]]
- [[Integration of Zettelkasten into Lifestyle and Thinking]]
- [[Properties of Zettels and Links]]
- [[Digital Garden - Publishing Zettelkasten to the web]]


I host my Zettelgarten with quartz. See [[My digital garden]]
