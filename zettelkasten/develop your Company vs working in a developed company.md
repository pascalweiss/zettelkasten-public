There is a set of ideals that a company should provide as a framework for high productivity. Especially in the field of software development, there is: 
- modern tech stack
- efficient work processes
- a good communication culture
- agile requirements engineering with regular releases
- Etc.

These ideals allow the developers to do their work with low distraction, giving them the ability to understand and to implement the customers requirements. 

This is exactly what most developers want. This is their comfort zone. And for Junior developers, this is the perfect environment to grow and to learn best practices. 

But as as a developer heading towards senior level or above, it might be a better challenge not to work in such an environment, but to establish it. 

The absence of an ideal development environment brings the challenge to not only develop the product, but to develop the team and the company. This is an opportunity to grow: 
- in communication
- in inspiring people
- in pursueing Long time goals 
- In developing a strategy

Still this doesn't mean, that a less developed company is a better place to work. But it might have potentials that might not always be obvious
