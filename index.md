#public


This is my little corner of the internet, where I share my thoughts and ideas. My main interests revolve around IT topics like software design, programming, and operations. Iâ€™m also passionate about topics like mindfulness and personal growth.

I started taking note-taking seriously in 2024 when I discovered the - Zettelkasten system by Niklas Luhmann. Since then, it has become an invaluable tool for me. The Zettelkasten method emphasises well-interconnected notes, with concise content and a clear structure, making them ready for publication at any time.
Iâ€™ve followed these principles for quite some time. 

Now that my collection of notes has grown significantly, I feel itâ€™s time to share them â€” as my digital garden, second brain, or whatever you may call it. And this is what you see here. 

So this space is for me, to explore ideas and grow, without worrying about praise or attention. Still I hope you find value in what I share here!
