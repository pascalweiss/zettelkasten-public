- You learn about DevOps, which is often left out in the cold by developers.
- New software components are brought into a real-world context, i.e. a cluster deployment.
- homelabs allow to deploy useful applications, that can be used either personally, by friends or family, or maybe even publicly. 
- With a working kubernetes cluster, trying to implement a production ready product is much more compelling, since infrastructe is already there. You can concentrate on your idea. 
- Like with a zettelkasten, you bring your ideas in a reusable form. For more on this, see [[Similarities between homelab and zettelkasten]]
